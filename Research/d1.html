        <h1>Fundamental Research (D1)</h1>
       
    <div>
        We aim at making robotic system autonomous and bring them in real world environments and solve real-world
        problems.
        Since legislation is one of the key barriers to doing so, we also work on the development of novel teleoperation
        systems to assist the human operator during complex teleoperation tasks (robotic surgery, nuclear sort and
        segregation). This makes teleoperation a much easier and cheaper solution allowing more penetration of robotic
        technologies in the market.

            hand-designed features?

        <li> How can a robot learn the motion control for complex interactive tasks?

        <li> How best we can reduce the cognitive workload on a human operator (e.g., a surgeon) during
            teleoperation by intelligent systems?
    </ul>



    From theoretical point of view, my research focuses on:
    <ol>

        <li> Data driven motion planning and control (presented in Sanni 2022; and Mandil 2022 papers; and
            Tafuro 2022; and Bonvicini 2022 submissions)

        <li> Robot learning from demonstrations (Ghalamzan 2015, Ghalamzan 2018 and Osa 2017)

    </ol>


    <div>
        \<h2>Robot Learning from Demonstrations (LfD)</h2> LfD is key to bring robots to human workspaces at scale. It
        also
        can help reduce programming time and cost so that non-experts can easily programme a robot for different tasks.
        The links between robot and human LfD (Ghalamzan 2015 Incremental and Ghalamzan 2018} demonstrates the available
        technologies are far away from the corresponding human capabilities of learning from observations. We have been
        working on developing LfD approaches for a wide range of applications, e.g. Breast Cancer Examination robot
        (Sanni 2022), strawberry picking (Alessandra 2022), simple pick-and-place (Ghalamzan 2015 incremental and
        Ghalamzan 2018) and nuclear sort and segregation (Osa 2017 guiding). We are keen to develop fundamental concepts
        to make LfD available for non-expert users across several application domains.
    </div>
    <div>
        \<h2>Data-driven predictive models (DPM)</h2>: Most manipulation tasks involve interaction with environments.
        These interactions are always challenging to model via classical approaches; hence, they are complicated to
        control. We are interested in developing data-driven predictive forward models that can help a robot to interact
        with its environment. For instance, Nazari et al. 2021 and Willow et al. 2022 present action conditioned
        predictive models for tactile sensors. DPM can be used for, e.g., robust object manipulation by slip
        avoidance controller via model predictive control (MPC). It can be also used for cluster manipulation for
        picking up an object on the shelf or strawberry picking (Mghames et al. 2020). Predictive models are a core part
        of a robust interactive robotic task.
    </div>
    <div>
        \<h2>Reduced cognitive load teleoperation</h2> Fully teleoperated robotic systems are the sole solutions to
        many problems, e.g. from robotic surgery to nuclear sort & segregation. These conservative industries do not
        trust a fully autonomous system even if such a system is available and needs a human operator to be in charge of
        the task execution. We worked on a new technology of shared control which can bridge the gap between autonomous
        systems and fully teleoperated systems. We proposed to use haptic force cues as a means to guide human
        operators. The guidance in teleoperation can provide a human operator with optimal actions in using a surgical
        robot (Selvaggio et al. 2019) or predicted singularities (Ghalamzan et al. 2017}, and collision (Parsa et al.
        2020} and minimum required torques (Rahal et al. 2022). Haptic guidance is important in reducing the cognitive
        workload (Talha et al. 2016). Motion scaling is also a factor in reducing the cognitive workload (Parsa et al.
        2022). We envisage an Intelligent Tele-operation System benefiting from Intelligent Autonomous System via haptic
        guidance or adaptive motion scaling. That can increase the penetration of robotic technologies in the market and
        make them cheaper solutions, e.g. it can significantly reduce the operation time of robotic surgery.
    </div>


    <div>
        \<h2>Robotic grasping and manipulation</h2> Our work in grasping and manipulation is manifold: <b>(1)</b>
        task-informed grasping (TIG); <b>(2)</b> Motion planning; <b>(3)</b> Motion Control. The common practice of
        robotic grasping
        includes an intelligent system extracting grasp related features from RGB-D images. This alone is not enough for
        effective and robust robotic grasping as the synthesised grasp may not be good enough for a specific
        manipulator. Task-informed grasping considers robot specific objectives into consideration in selecting the
        grasp poses. Hence, the robot can predict the consequences of the grasp actions (e.g. singularity (Ghalamzan et
        al. 2016), torques (Mavrakis et al. 2016), torques (Mavrakis et ai. 2017), collision (Pardi et al. 2018) and
        affordance (Pardi et al. 2021) during the planned manipulative movements of a follower manipulator.

        We also work on motion planning for interactive for interactive robotic manipulation motion planning and control
        are needed. For effective motion planning for robotic cutting, one should define the robot movements based on
        the surface of the object to be cut (Pardi et al. 2020). For robotic breast palpation (to localise the cancerous
        lumps) motion control and searching policy, such as RL, are required (Giorgo et al. 2022).
